# ClanWorld v4.6 Addendum — Phase 5 Economy Alignment (Path A: as-built canonization)

**Status:** Authoritative addendum, scoped to Phase 5 gathering / deposit / economy mechanics
**Read order:** This doc supersedes the gathering-yield and economy-rate language in `clanworld_v4_spec.md` §3.10, §4.3–4.13, `clanworld_v4_1_addendum.md` A5–A6, A10, and the economy-related constants in `clanworld_v4_2_state_schema_interface_spec.md` §5. When implementers or UAT runners find disagreement on yield rates, carry caps, or starvation semantics, this doc wins.
**Purpose:** Canonize the as-built Phase 5 batched-action economy as the authoritative Phase 5 ruleset for the hackathon submission, and explicitly enumerate the v4 mechanics that diverged as DEFERRED-TO-RESTORATION.
**Audience:** Reviewers, UAT runners against the contract on World Chain Sepolia / Base Sepolia, future restoration work.

## 0. Why this doc exists — Path A decision (Liam, 2026-04-30)

A spec-vs-impl audit by Claude Opus 4.7 (1M ctx) — the "PR #193 spec-compliance UAT" report at [`docs/reviews/pr193-spec-compliance-uat.md`](../reviews/pr193-spec-compliance-uat.md) — confirmed that the Phase 5 economy implementation diverges from the v4 spec on 14 substantial mechanics. The core structural divergence is **action lifecycle**: the v4 spec modeled gathering as a continuous tick-by-tick yield loop ("resolve tick-by-tick until stopped or blocked"); the implementation uses a **batched-action model** where each gather submission yields a single batch (4 ticks of work) and then terminates, requiring a new submission with cooldown.

Two interpretive paths were available:

- **Path A (chosen)** — declare the implementation canonical, write this addendum as the new authoritative ruleset, defer the v4-specific mechanics to a post-hackathon restoration milestone.
- **Path B (rejected for hackathon timeline)** — declare the v4 spec canonical, treat the implementation as drift, rewrite the gathering pipeline to continuous per-tick semantics.

Path A was selected because:
1. The batched-action model is deeply structural — the `getActionDuration / executesAtTick / settlesAtTick` mission shape was locked in Phases 3–4 (merged PRs #181/#183). Phase 5 inherits and extends it; reverting would invalidate downstream phases.
2. The hackathon timeline makes a gathering pipeline rewrite (Path B) untenable — multi-day lift for Phase 5.2–5.4, with regression risk across Phase 6–9.
3. The as-built code is internally consistent and well-tested for its own batched semantics. The multi-round super-swarm and per-issue PR pipeline already validated it.
4. Per-action yield magnitudes (4 ticks × yield_per_tick) are calibrated to the batched duty cycle, and can be rebalanced post-hackathon under restoration without touching architecture.

This doc canonizes the as-built mechanics. The 14 drift items are tracked as deferred-to-restoration on GH issue [#352](https://github.com/OmniPass-world/clan-world/issues/352) under the `spec-v4-restoration-post-hackathon` GH milestone (#25) for later evaluation.

## 1. Scope of this addendum

**In scope:** gathering mechanics (wood, iron, fish, wheat), deposit, carry caps, upkeep, starvation, wheat plot lifecycle, starting vault — as implemented in:

- `packages/contracts/src/ClanWorld.sol` — gather helpers, `_doDeposit`, `_applyUpkeep`, wheat plot regrow, starvation flag
- `packages/contracts/src/IClanWorld.sol` — economy constants, `Clan` struct vault fields, `WheatPlot` struct, carry fields
- `packages/contracts/test/Gathering.t.sol`, `ClanWorld.t.sol` — codified behavior

**Out of scope:** all non-economy mechanics. Bandit interactions with vault state (loot value getter — see `clanworld_v4_6_bandit_phase9_redesign.md`), winter mechanics (deferred — §9), market mechanics (Phase 6), deaths (Phase 10), gold/blueprint payouts. The rest of the v4 spec remains canonical unless overridden by a later addendum.

**Authoritative as of HEAD:** `9b67414f87ab6c83cf848fbe8a8bd7e3dcc03218` (origin/dev-phase-5-economy, the HEAD against which the spec-compliance UAT was run).

---

## 2. As-built batched-action lifecycle

### 2.1 Action model

The v4 spec (§3.10) described gathering as a **continuous** action: "resolve tick-by-tick until stopped or blocked." The implementation uses a **batched-action model**:

- Every gather action has `getActionDuration = 4` — the mission `settlesAtTick = actionStartTick + 4`.
- `_settleMissionForClansman` calls `_resolveAction` only when `tick >= settlesAtTick` — i.e., 4 ticks after the action starts.
- At resolution, the gather helper credits `YIELD_PER_TICK × 4` to the clansman's carry in one atomic call, then `_completeMission` terminates the mission.
- The worker transitions to WAITING. To gather again, the Elder must submit a new `ChopWood` (or equivalent) mission, subject to cooldown.

**There is no continuous per-tick yield loop.** One gather submission = one batch = one settlement.

### 2.2 Gather mission lifecycle (canonical)

```
Submit gather order
  → validation: worker reachable + carry not already full + target region correct
  → action stamp: actionStartTick = currentTick, settlesAtTick = currentTick + 4
  → cooldown stamp on submission (A5)
per tick: _settleMissionForClansman runs
  → if tick < settlesAtTick: noop (traveling or waiting for batch to complete)
  → if tick >= settlesAtTick: resolve batch
      → gather helper called once
      → yield = YIELD_PER_TICK × 4 (± crit/RNG modifier per §3)
      → yield clamped to remaining carry capacity
      → if carry already at cap: _completeMission immediately (no yield)
      → carry += yield; emit ResourcesGathered
      → _completeMission → worker WAITING
```

**After _completeMission:** worker is WAITING at gather region. Elder must travel home + deposit + submit new gather, or submit gather again from the same region (subject to cooldown).

### 2.3 Deposit lifecycle

Deposit is a **single-tick action** per spec §3.10 (unchanged by this addendum):

- `DEPOSIT_DURATION_TICKS = 1`
- Worker must be at own clan's `baseRegion`
- Atomically transfers all 4 carry resources to vault in one settlement
- Empty-carry deposit is a silent no-op (no event emitted)
- `ResourcesDeposited` event emitted on non-empty deposit with per-resource deltas + `atTick`

### 2.4 Cooldown semantics (A5 unchanged)

Per `clanworld_v4_1_addendum.md` A5 (unchanged): every successful mission submission starts cooldown (`cooldownEndsAtTs`). This applies to gather + deposit. A clansman whose cooldown is active cannot accept a new mission submission. This means the effective gather duty cycle is: **4 ticks ON + cooldown-period OFF per batch**.

## 3. Per-action yields — canonical as-built values

### 3.1 Wood (Forest)

| Property | As-built canonical | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Base yield per batch | `WOOD_YIELD_PER_TICK × 4 = 1e18 × 4 = 4e18` | `IClanWorld.sol:50, 54`; `ClanWorld.sol:493` |
| Crit chance | `WOOD_CRIT_BPS = 1000` (10%) | `IClanWorld.sol:55` |
| Crit effect | multiply yield × 2 → **8e18 on crit** | `ClanWorld.sol:495-497` |
| RNG domain key | `keccak256(abi.encode("wood_crit", tickSeed, clansmanId, missionNonce, tick))` | `ClanWorld.sol:494` |
| Region | `REGION_FOREST` | — |

**Ratified design decisions:**
- **Crit shape is ×2 multiplicative** (not +1e18 additive as in v4 §4.7). Rationale: the as-built multiplier is simpler, internally consistent, and already tested. Restoring additive crit is tracked as item #4 in §10.
- **Wood yield per tick is 1e18** (half of v4 spec's 2e18). Yield rate drift is a consequence of the batched model: 1e18/tick × 4-tick batch = 4e18 per submission. Restoration to 2e18/tick per spec is tracked as item #2 in §10.

### 3.2 Iron (Mountains)

| Property | As-built canonical | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Base yield per batch | `IRON_YIELD_PER_TICK × 4 = 1.25e17 × 4 = 5e17 = 0.5e18` | `IClanWorld.sol:57-58`; `ClanWorld.sol:524` |
| Gold bonus chance | `GOLD_FROM_IRON_BPS = 200` (2%) | `IClanWorld.sol:59` |
| Gold bonus amount | `GOLD_FROM_IRON_AMOUNT = 1e18` | `IClanWorld.sol:60` |
| Gold bonus roll cadence | **once per batch call** (not once per tick) | `ClanWorld.sol:539-548` |
| RNG domain key | `keccak256(abi.encode("iron_gold_bonus", ...))` | `ClanWorld.sol:543` |
| Region | `REGION_MOUNTAINS` | — |

**Ratified design decisions:**
- **Gold bonus rolls once per 4-tick batch** (not once per action tick). Sustained gold-bonus opportunity rate = 2% per batch vs spec's 2%/tick. Restoring per-tick roll cadence is tracked as item #6 in §10.
- **Iron per-tick rate is 0.125e18** (¼ of spec's 0.5e18/tick). Restoration tracked as item #5.

### 3.3 Fish — Docks (West/East Docks)

| Property | As-built canonical | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Hit chance | `FISH_DOCKS_BPS = 2500` (25%) | `IClanWorld.sol:65` |
| Yield on hit | `FISH_YIELD_PER_TICK × 4 = 25e16 × 4 = 1e18` | `IClanWorld.sol:63`; `ClanWorld.sol:563-578` |
| Yield on miss | 0 | — |
| Roll cadence | **once per batch call** | `ClanWorld.sol:563-578` |
| RNG domain key | `keccak256(abi.encode("fish_roll", ...))` | `ClanWorld.sol:564` |
| Regions | `REGION_WEST_DOCKS`, `REGION_EAST_DOCKS` | — |

**Sustained expected value per batch:** 25% × 1e18 = 0.25e18 fish per batch.

**Ratified design decision:** Roll cadence is once per batch (not once per action tick). Restoration tracked as item #7.

### 3.4 Fish — Deep Sea

| Property | As-built canonical | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Hit chance | `FISH_DEEP_BPS = 7500` (75%) | `IClanWorld.sol:66` |
| Yield on hit | `FISH_YIELD_PER_TICK × 4 = 25e16 × 4 = 1e18` | `IClanWorld.sol:63`; `ClanWorld.sol:594-609` |
| Yield on miss | 0 | — |
| Roll cadence | once per batch call | `ClanWorld.sol:594-609` |
| RNG domain key | `keccak256(abi.encode("fish_roll", ...))` | `ClanWorld.sol:595` |
| Region | `REGION_DEEP_SEA` | — |

**Sustained expected value per batch:** 75% × 1e18 = 0.75e18 fish per batch.

### 3.5 Wheat (West/East Farms)

| Property | As-built canonical | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Base yield per batch | `WHEAT_YIELD_PER_TICK × 4 = 5e18 × 4 = 20e18` | `IClanWorld.sol:62`; `ClanWorld.sol:646` |
| Regions | `REGION_WEST_FARMS` (plot 0), `REGION_EAST_FARMS` (plot 1) | `ClanWorld.sol:626-637` |
| Plot depletion | yield clamped to `plot.remainingWheat`; plot enters Regrowing when `remainingWheat == 0` | `ClanWorld.sol:648-659` |

**Ratified design decision:** Wheat per-tick rate is 5e18 (¼ of spec's 20e18/tick per continuous model). Restoration tracked as item #9.

---

## 4. Per-resource carry caps — canonical as-built values

These supersede the carry cap values in `clanworld_v4_spec.md` §4.3 and `clanworld_v4_2_state_schema_interface_spec.md` §5.

| Resource | Spec value (deprecated) | As-built canonical | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wood | 15e18 | **10e18** (`WOOD_CAP = CLANSMAN_CARRY_CAP = 10e18`) | `IClanWorld.sol:43-44` |
| Iron | 5e18 | **5e18** | `IClanWorld.sol:45` ✅ unchanged |
| Wheat | 40e18 | **40e18** | `IClanWorld.sol:46` ✅ unchanged |
| Fish | 8e18 | **8e18** | `IClanWorld.sol:47` ✅ unchanged |

**Ratified design decision:** Wood carry cap is **10e18**, not 15e18. `WOOD_CAP` is aliased to the generic `WOOD_CAP = CLANSMAN_CARRY_CAP` constant (10e18). Restoring to spec's 15e18 is tracked as item #10 in §10.

**Carry enforcement mechanics (unchanged from spec):** each gather helper enforces the per-resource cap independently. Yield is clamped to `cap - currentCarry` if it would overflow. If carry is already at cap when resolution fires, the mission terminates immediately (no yield credited). This matches spec §4.8.

---

## 5. Upkeep and starvation semantics

### 5.1 Per-tick upkeep

Per living clansman per tick (unchanged from spec):

| Resource | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Wheat | `WHEAT_UPKEEP_PER_CLANSMAN = 1e18` | `IClanWorld.sol:69` |
| Fish | `FISH_UPKEEP_PER_CLANSMAN = 1e17` | `IClanWorld.sol:70` |

Upkeep applies only when `clan.livingClansmen > 0`. If the vault cannot fully satisfy the wheat or fish demand, the respective vault field is drained to 0 (not negative).

Execution order in `_settleClan` (per tick): `_applyUpkeep` → wheat-plot regrow → per-clansman mission settlement. Upkeep fires before any mission resolution in that tick, which means same-tick deposit cannot rescue that tick's upkeep (A6 compliant).

### 5.2 Starvation onset — same-tick ratification

**Ratified design decision:** starvation activates on the **same tick** as the upkeep failure (not the "next tick" specified in v4 §4.11).

v4 §4.11 states: "If the vault cannot satisfy both wheat and fish demands in full, **starvation status begins on the next tick**." The implementation sets `clan.starvationStartsAtTick = tick` (i.e., the current tick) inside `_applyUpkeep`, and derives `_isStarving = starvationStartsAtTick != 0 && starvationStartsAtTick <= currentTick`. This means `_isStarving == true` at the end of the tick the upkeep fails.

**Rationale for ratifying same-tick:** simpler state derivation; defenders contributing 0 takes effect immediately on the failure tick (cleaner UX for players — starvation is visible at the tick where it happens, not one tick later). Restoration to next-tick semantics is tracked as item #14 in §10.

### 5.3 Starvation effects (unchanged from spec, A10)

While `_isStarving == true`:

- All gather outputs are reduced by 50% (`yield = yield / 2` applied in wood/iron/fish-docks/fish-deep/wheat helpers before carry assignment)
- Defense contribution = 0 (starving clans are ineligible for `_resolveBanditAttack` defender path)
- No death from starvation outside winter (summer starvation = debuff only, matches A10)

Note: wheat plot depletion uses the post-halving yield value when calculating `plot.remainingWheat -= yield`, so the plot drains at the same rate as carry accumulation (no double-deduct bug).

### 5.4 Starvation recovery

Starvation clears in the same `_applyUpkeep` tick where the vault CAN satisfy both wheat + fish in full: `if (!starving && clan.starvationStartsAtTick != 0) clan.starvationStartsAtTick = 0`. Recovery is immediate (same tick as successful upkeep payment).

---

## 6. Wheat plot lifecycle

| State | Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `Harvestable` | `remainingWheat > 0` | Clansman can harvest; yield clamped to min(20e18, remainingWheat) per batch |
| `Regrowing` | `remainingWheat == 0` | No harvest; regrow timer: `regrowUntilTick = tick + WHEAT_PLOT_REGROW_TICKS` |
| `WinterLocked` | Winter active (see §9) | **Not wired in impl** — enum value declared, behavior deferred |

**Regrow → Harvestable:** when `tick >= regrowUntilTick`, the per-tick `_settleClan` loop resets the plot: `state = Harvestable; remainingWheat = 100e18`.

**Starting state per `mintClan`:** both West and East Farms start `Harvestable` at 100e18.

`WHEAT_PLOT_REGROW_TICKS` is the canonical regrow duration. Both plots (`targetRegion == REGION_WEST_FARMS` → `plotIdx = 0`, `targetRegion == REGION_EAST_FARMS` → `plotIdx = 1`) follow identical mechanics.

---

## 7. Deposit mechanics (unchanged from spec)

| Property | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Duration | `DEPOSIT_DURATION_TICKS = 1` (single-tick action) | `ClanWorld.sol:77, 1804-1806` |
| Location requirement | worker at own `clan.baseRegion` | `ClanWorld.sol:670-674, 1611-1614` |
| Transfer semantics | all 4 carry resources → vault atomically; carry fields zeroed | `ClanWorld.sol:682-695` |
| Empty-carry behavior | silent no-op, no event | `ClanWorld.sol:675-680` |
| Event | `ResourcesDeposited(clanId, woodDelta, ironDelta, wheatDelta, fishDelta, atTick)` | `IClanWorld.sol:541-549` |
| Error on wrong region | `ERR_NOT_AT_HOMEBASE` | `IClanWorld.sol:171` |

---

## 8. Starting vault and gold (§12.4, §12.5 — unchanged from spec)

| Field | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `vaultWood` | 20e18 | `ClanWorld.sol:1037` |
| `vaultIron` | 0 | `ClanWorld.sol:1038` |
| `vaultWheat` | 20e18 | `ClanWorld.sol:1039` |
| `vaultFish` | 2e18 | `ClanWorld.sol:1040` |
| `goldBalance` | 3e18 | `ClanWorld.sol:1034` |

---

## 9. Winter mechanics — deferred (Phase 5.6 / Phase 7)

The following winter mechanics are declared in constants but **not wired in the implementation**. They are explicitly out of scope for Phase 5B and will be implemented under Phase 5.6 (starvation upkeep) and Phase 7 (winter season):

| Mechanic | v4 spec rule | Impl status | Constant declared |
|---|---|---|---|
| Winter wheat plot lockdown (§7.4) | plots enter `WinterLocked` at winter start; no harvest | NOT IMPLEMENTED — `_gatherWheat` does not check `winterActive`; `WinterLocked` enum value is dead | `WheatPlotState.WinterLocked` in `IClanWorld.sol:125` |
| Winter upkeep 2× (§7.3) | wheat + fish consumption doubles during winter | NOT IMPLEMENTED — `_applyUpkeep` uses flat rate regardless of `winterActive` | `WINTER_UPKEEP_MULTIPLIER_BPS = 20000` in `IClanWorld.sol` (unused) |
| Winter wood burn (§7.3) | 1e18 wood per base per tick during winter | NOT IMPLEMENTED — `_applyUpkeep` does not touch `vaultWood`; no winter check | `WINTER_WOOD_BURN_PER_BASE = 1e18` in `IClanWorld.sol:71` (unused) |
| WinterLocked → Regrowing at winter end (v4_2 §7.4) | on winter end, locked plots → Regrowing | NOT IMPLEMENTED | — |

**Behavior during winter (as-built):** Gathering and deposit work exactly as described in §2–§7 above, regardless of whether winter is active. Upkeep rates are flat (non-doubled). Wood burn does not fire.

---

## 10. Deferred to v4-restoration milestone (`spec-v4-restoration-post-hackathon`)

The following 14 drift items are tracked for evaluation under the `spec-v4-restoration-post-hackathon` GH milestone (#25) and the umbrella tracking issue [#352](https://github.com/OmniPass-world/clan-world/issues/352). Restoration is conditional on post-hackathon evaluation.

| # | v4 spec mechanic | As-built behavior | Restoration cost (rough) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Continuous tick-by-tick yield** (§3.10) — gather resolves once per tick, looping until stopped or blocked | Batched: 1 gather submission = 4-tick batch = 1 settlement; mission terminates after each batch | Large — requires reworking the mission lifecycle for gather actions; touches `getActionDuration`, `_resolveAction`, cooldown semantics for continuous actions |
| 2 | **Wood base yield 2e18/tick** (§4.7) — 2e18 per action tick (with continuous model) | 1e18/tick × 4 = 4e18/batch in batched model | Tiny constant change — but only meaningful after item #1 restores continuous model |
| 3 | **Wood crit chance 20%** (§4.7) | `WOOD_CRIT_BPS = 1000` (10%) | Tiny — 1 constant |
| 4 | **Wood crit shape additive +1e18** (§4.7) — crit ADDS +1e18 → total 3e18/tick | Crit DOUBLES yield → 8e18/batch | Small — modify crit branch in `_gatherWood` |
| 5 | **Iron base yield 0.5e18/tick** (§4.7) | 0.125e18/tick × 4 = 0.5e18/batch | Tiny constant — but meaningful only after #1 |
| 6 | **Iron gold bonus per-tick roll** (§4.7) — roll at every action tick | Rolls once per 4-tick batch call | Small — loop the roll or roll once per tick in continuous model |
| 7 | **Fish docks 25%/tick × 1e18** (§4.7) | 25% per batch call × 1e18 | Tiny constant — meaningful after #1 |
| 8 | **Fish deep sea 75%/tick × 1e18** (§4.7) | 75% per batch call × 1e18 | Tiny constant — meaningful after #1 |
| 9 | **Wheat harvest rate 20e18/tick** (§4.9) | 5e18/tick × 4 = 20e18/batch | Tiny constant — meaningful after #1 |
| 10 | **Wood carry cap 15e18** (§4.3) | `WOOD_CAP = CLANSMAN_CARRY_CAP = 10e18` | Tiny — 1 constant in `IClanWorld.sol:43-44` (alias decoupling required) |
| 11 | **Winter wheat plot lockdown** (§7.4) — plots enter `WinterLocked` at winter start; no harvest | `WinterLocked` enum state declared, not wired | Small–Medium — wire winter-start heartbeat to set plot state; add check in `_gatherWheat`; wire winter-end → Regrowing |
| 12 | **Winter upkeep 2× multiplier** (§7.3) — wheat + fish consumption doubles in winter | Flat rate; `WINTER_UPKEEP_MULTIPLIER_BPS = 20000` declared, unused | Small — multiply upkeep by `WINTER_UPKEEP_MULTIPLIER_BPS` when `winterActive` in `_applyUpkeep` |
| 13 | **Winter wood burn 1e18/base/tick** (§7.3) | Not implemented; `WINTER_WOOD_BURN_PER_BASE = 1e18` declared, unused | Small — add wood burn branch in `_applyUpkeep` when `winterActive` |
| 14 | **Starvation onset next-tick** (§4.11) — starvation begins on the tick after upkeep failure | Starvation activates same tick as failure (`starvationStartsAtTick = tick`) | Small — change to `starvationStartsAtTick = tick + 1`; audit consumers for off-by-one |

Items 11–13 partially overlap with Phase 5.6 (starvation upkeep) and Phase 7 (winter season) scope. Those phases will address them regardless.

## 11. Constants — as-built canonical values

These supersede the economy-related constants in `clanworld_v4_2_state_schema_interface_spec.md` §5 for the listed entries.

| Constant | Spec value (deprecated) | As-built canonical | Source |

## 12. UAT runners — what to expect

When running interactive UAT against this contract, **expect the as-built mechanics (this addendum), not v4 §3.10 / §4.3–4.13**. Specifically:

- ✅ Each gather order yields one batch (4 ticks of work) and terminates. Worker enters WAITING. To gather more, submit a new order after cooldown.
- ✅ Wood: 4e18 per batch base, 8e18 on crit (10% chance) — NOT 2e18/tick continuous
- ✅ Iron: 0.5e18 per batch, 2% chance of +1e18 gold bonus per batch — NOT 0.5e18/tick continuous
- ✅ Fish docks: 25% × 1e18 per batch — NOT 25% × 1e18/tick
- ✅ Fish deep sea: 75% × 1e18 per batch — NOT 75% × 1e18/tick
- ✅ Wheat: 20e18 per batch — NOT 20e18/tick continuous
- ✅ Wood carry cap is 10e18 (NOT 15e18)
- ✅ Starvation activates on the SAME TICK as upkeep failure (NOT next tick)
- ✅ Wheat plots remain harvestable during winter (WinterLocked NOT wired)
- ✅ Winter upkeep doubling NOT active; flat upkeep rates apply year-round
- ✅ Winter wood burn NOT active

If a UAT scenario expects v4-spec continuous yields, per-tick rates, or winter lockdown behavior, it will fail against this contract. Use this addendum as the oracle.
